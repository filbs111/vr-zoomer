after imagemagick convert, size = 1303x1624

according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart

"Visual acuity = Distance at which test is made / distance at which the smallest optotype identified subtends an angle of five arcminutes.[citation needed]"

. AFAICT, 20/20 line should be presented like this - ie, subtending angle of 5 arcminutes.

5 arcminutes = 5/60 degrees => 0.00145 radians.

therefore height of these letters should be distance to chart * 0.00145

the height of these letters = 28px, but hard to read. see that 20/200 at 270px . half this = 27px, guess more accurate measure.

entire chart = 

1303x1624  * 0.00145/27  =  0.06997 x 0.08721

if place chart 2 away and scale 2x2x2 box (from -1 to 1) by these numbers, expect to look right
